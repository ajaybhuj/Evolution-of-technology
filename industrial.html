      <h2>The Industrial Revolution:Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Industrial Revolution, a transformative period spanning the 18th and
        19th centuries, reshaped society, economies, and technology. It was
        characterized by a shift from agrarian and handcraft-based economies to
        industrial and machine-based production.
      </p>
      <h2>Steam Power and Mechanization:</h2>
      <p>
        One of the defining features of the Industrial Revolution was the
        harnessing of steam power through inventions like James Watt's steam
        engine. Steam engines powered factories, ships, and trains,
        revolutionizing transportation and manufacturing.
      </p>
      <h2>Textile Revolution:</h2>
      <p>
        The mechanization of textile production marked a turning point.
        Water-powered spinning machines and power looms brought efficiency to
        cloth manufacturing, triggering the factory system. Mass production
        became a reality, transforming the nature of work and labor.
      </p>
      <h2>Metallurgy and Infrastructure:</h2>
      <p>
        Advancements in metallurgy, including the Bessemer process, enabled the
        mass production of iron and steel. This revolutionized construction,
        allowing for the creation of bridges, railways, and skyscrapers. The
        landscape of cities underwent a profound change.
      </p>
      <h2>Electrification and Communication:</h2>
      <p>
        The introduction of electricity led to the development of electric
        lights, motors, and communication systems. Telephones connected people
        across distances, fostering new means of interaction and commerce.
      </p>
      <h2>Social and Economic Impact:</h2>
      <p>
        The Industrial Revolution led to urbanization as people moved to cities
        for work in factories. It brought about significant social changes,
        labor movements, and debates about workers' rights. The division of
        labor and the concept of a "working class" emerged.
